This is the software for the “Lichtspiel”, an Arduino-based device I made as a birthday present for my niece. Read more about it here: https://noniq.at/0017/the-lichtspiel/

The project includes a Makefile. If you have [Arduino-Makefile](https://github.com/sudar/Arduino-Makefile) installed, you can use the Makefile to build and upload the code, simply adjust the settings in the Makefile accordingly.

Building should work with the standard Arduino IDE, too, but I haven’t tested that.
